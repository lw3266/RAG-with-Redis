# RAG-with-Redis
An attempt to clone the Google Vertex AI search. Trying out Redis for retrieval augmented generation.

### Getting Started
Refer to [instructions.md](/instructions.MD) for the commands needed.

You should also have Redis and most of the python libraries installed (huggingface transformers, redis, and some additional misc dependencies if error comes up).

This project intends to have the llms run locally, and the models can be downloaded from Huggingface. Note that if you are using a different model than the ones in the python files, you may need to adjust the `EMBED_DIM`.

### What to Expect
You will be able to have a LLM answer questions specifically based on the content from a pdf textbook, or some notes you have.

First place those in a folder, and run the ingest file to embed those content then store into Redis.

Then run the rag file to perform KNN vector search. This process is under work, where I need to improve the search result through a different embedding method, or the way I handle images in the pdf.

The chat box should appear in the terminal, and type in your questions there.

### Acknowledgement and Warnings
Many parts of my code in this project is generated by LLM, and may have referenced many other developers' work. 

This project is for me to learn Redis, and it is far away from production ready type of tools. There can be many bugs
